title: Financial Modeling Tool Idea
---


I talked about this a little bit in Ideas for Projects, but there are a few more ideas that would be cool and would add efficiencies at work. Particularly, I've been considering creating a financial model tool. The tool would allow analysts to view an entity based off hypthetical performance metrics alongside actual performance metrics. This would be a great way to target what part of an entity should be focused on to promote same store growth. I've seen similar ideas, but most are vague to the point o not being useful. This would be very targeted to specific companies.

It is a longer term project, but I think it could be very valuable.
