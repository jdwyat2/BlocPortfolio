title: Development Goals
---

Before I talk about my development goals, I think it is important to give a little bit of background regarding my history. My education experience has always been pointed in the direction of analytics of one form or another. In undergrad, I studied International Economics then in grad school I studied Environmental Economics. So, I never really had any formal exposure to software development or coding. 
Several years ago, I started a job as a Business Analyst--mainly I was running statistical analysis, but the job became increasingly about data and using it efficiently. Naturally, that has led me down a path to start looking at programming.
Bloc is one step along that path, and I'm looking forward to where that will take me.
