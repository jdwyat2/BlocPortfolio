title: Ideas for Projects
---


After I finish with Bloc, there are a couple of ideas that I am thinking about working on to develop the coding/developer part of my resume.

*Long-term, it may be a good idea to look into a project management certification of some sort.
*In the short term, I would like to do something simple in React. At work they use React for all web applications.
**Create a regulatory document manager system. I've already created a SQL server system to manage the data, so I would just need to create a web form to connect that to.

Besides, having projects to work on for work, I have a few ideas for fun projects. Particularly, there are a few neat Rasberry Pi projects that I would like to toy with.

*House plant waterer on a timer. 
*Yard irrigation system.
*Home weather station.
