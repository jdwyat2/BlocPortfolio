# The project

BlocJams is the first project that I've attempted from start to finish. It is a stream-lined audio player. That can organize an album and play individual tracks. 

### Why is it important

There are tons of audio players all over the internet, so why would I bother to write another one--besides it being a requirement of the bloc bootcamp syllabus? BlocJams gave me a great introduction to front-end programming. I started the program only ever completing CodeSchool's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses. They were great, but you never learn until you do, so BlocJams was created.

### What problems were there

Early on in making BlocJams, I got a very important lesson about the importance of making sure your git is neat and well organized. I won't say its the worse thing ever, but it is pretty unsettling looking for a commit that represents 3-4 hours of work, and not being able to find it. Suffice it to say, I am a believer that you shouldn't feel shy about committing often.

I also learned a little bit about myself. I think of myself as a detail-oriented person, but now I know that trying to make sure every semicolon, bracket, and parentesis is appropriately written into your code will test anyone. I now understand the joy of struggling through a javaScript function, feeling good about it, and then not being able to get it to work for a good 2 hours of looking for the mistake--which is generally a semicolon that didn't get written.

### How did it turn out

I feel good about this project. I know it is simple and not the most original, but BlocJams taught me a lot about how a developer's project flow is supposed to work. It gave me a good feel for how I need to plan for future front-end projects. It has been a fantastic learning tool, and I would recommend to any aspiring front-end devs to walk through it for a great whole-picture understanding of front-end work.
